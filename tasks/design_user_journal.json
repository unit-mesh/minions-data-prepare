      "input": "Animation and Comics",
      "output": "Sure, here's a possible design for a user journal for Animation and Comics:\n\n    User registration: Users can create an account by providing their name, email address, and a password.\n\n    Dashboard: Upon logging in, users are presented with a dashboard that displays their recent activity, such as the last project they worked on, the last comic they read, or the latest animation they watched.\n\n    Projects: Users can create, save, and manage their animation and comic projects. Each project contains information such as the title, description, characters, scenes, and assets. Users can upload their own assets or use pre-existing ones from the software.\n\n    Comics: Users can read and explore comics from different genres and publishers. The software can suggest comics based on the user's reading history and preferences.\n\n    Animations: Users can watch and explore animations from different studios and genres. The software can suggest animations based on the user's viewing history and preferences.\n\n    Social features: Users can follow other users, comment on their projects, comics, and animations, and like and share their work.\n\n    Notifications: Users can receive notifications about new updates, comments, and likes on their projects, comics, and animations.\n\n    Settings: Users can manage their account settings, such as their name, email, password, profile picture, and notification preferences.\n\n    Help and support: Users can access a help center with tutorials, FAQs, and contact information for customer support.\n\n    Feedback: Users can provide feedback on the software, suggest new features, report bugs, and rate the software.\n\nThis user journal design is just a starting point, and it can be further customized based on the specific needs and requirements of your software system."
